## Phase 2: User Feedback Collection (3-5 days)

### 2.1 Beta Testing Group
- Recruit 5-10 Pokemon card collectors
- Mix of casual and serious collectors
- Different device types (iPhone, Android, Desktop)
- Geographic distribution for latency testing

### 2.2 Feedback Collection Methods
- **Structured Survey**:
  - Overall satisfaction (1-5 scale)
  - Speed satisfaction
  - Accuracy satisfaction
  - UI/UX clarity
  - Feature requests
  - Bug reports

- **Usage Analytics**:
  - Processing times per tier
  - Error rates by type
  - Most scanned card types
  - Device/browser distribution
  - Geographic distribution

- **Direct Observation**:
  - Screen recording sessions
  - Think-aloud protocol
  - Task completion rates
  - Common confusion points

### 2.3 Key Questions to Answer
1. Is the processing speed acceptable?
2. Are the results accurate enough?
3. Is the UI intuitive for first-time users?
4. What features are missing for MVP?
5. Are there any critical bugs?

## Phase 3: Refinement Based on Feedback (2-3 days)

### 3.1 High-Priority Fixes
- Critical bugs (crashes, data loss)
- Accuracy issues on common cards
- Confusing UI elements
- Performance bottlenecks

### 3.2 Set Detection Improvements (Based on Oranguru V test case)
**Issue**: Gemini misidentified Astral Radiance as Silver Tempest, but fallback search still found correct card.

**Improvements to implement**:
1. **Enhanced Gemini Set Detection**
   - Update prompts to focus more on set symbols and identifiers
   - Add examples of common set naming patterns
   - Emphasize accuracy over speed for set identification

2. **Set Validation Logic**
   - Cross-check card numbers against known set ranges
   - Validate set/number combinations against TCG database
   - Flag mismatches for manual review or auto-correction

3. **Confidence Scoring for Sets**
   - Add confidence ratings for set identification
   - Prefer higher-confidence matches
   - Show uncertainty indicators when confidence is low

**Test Cases to Add**:
- IMG_5429.HEIC (Oranguru V Astral Radiance vs Silver Tempest confusion)
- Cards from sets with similar names
- Cards with worn/unclear set identifiers
- Reprints across multiple sets

### 3.3 Quick Improvements
