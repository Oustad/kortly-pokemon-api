================================================================

Status: PLANNING
Created: 2025-06-10
Previous: PRD7 (Speed Optimization - COMPLETED)

## Overview

This PRD captures the remaining enhancement items from PRD7's Phase 3 and deferred Phase 4 work.
Focus on user experience improvements, performance monitoring, and system scalability.

## Objectives

1. Enable batch processing for multiple cards
2. Implement intelligent caching for frequently scanned cards
3. Add comprehensive performance monitoring
4. Enhance error recovery and resilience
5. Implement API rate limiting and quota management

## Phase 1: Batch Processing Support

### Requirements
- Upload and process multiple card images in a single request
- Parallel processing with progress tracking
- Individual results for each card in the batch
- Batch size limits (e.g., max 10 cards per batch)

### Implementation
- New `/api/v1/scan/batch` endpoint
- Frontend multi-file selection and upload
- Progress indicators for each card
- Results gallery view

## Phase 2: Intelligent Caching

### Requirements
- Cache frequently scanned cards to reduce API calls
- LRU cache with configurable size
- Cache invalidation strategy
- Hit rate monitoring

### Implementation
- Redis or in-memory cache for card results
- Cache key based on image hash
- TTL configuration per tier
- Cache warming for popular cards

## Phase 3: Performance Monitoring

### Requirements
- Real-time performance metrics dashboard
- Historical performance trends
- API usage analytics
- Cost tracking and reporting

### Implementation
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Grafana dashboard
- Custom metrics endpoints
- Automated alerts for performance degradation

## Phase 4: Enhanced Error Recovery

### Requirements
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern for external APIs
- Graceful degradation strategies
- User-friendly error messages

### Implementation
- Tenacity retry decorators
- Circuit breaker for Gemini/TCG APIs
- Fallback responses
- Error classification and handling

## Phase 5: API Management

### Requirements
- Rate limiting per IP/user
- API key management
- Usage quotas and billing
- Developer portal

### Implementation
- FastAPI rate limiter middleware
- API key generation and validation
- Usage tracking database
- OpenAPI documentation

## Phase 6: Backend Optimization

### Requirements
- Connection pooling for external APIs
- Async processing optimization
- Database query optimization
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Implementation
- httpx connection pooling
- Async task queuing
- Database indexing
- Performance profiling

## Success Metrics

- Batch processing: <10s for 5 cards
- Cache hit rate: >60% for popular cards
- API availability: >99.9% uptime
- Error rate: <0.1% for valid requests
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5 rating

## Technical Debt from PRD7

- Optimize backend async processing and connection pooling
- Refactor image processor for better modularity
- Add comprehensive integration tests
- Documentation updates

## Future Considerations

- Mobile app development
- ML model fine-tuning
- Multi-language support
- Trading platform integration
- Community features
