================================================================

Status: PLANNING
Created: 2025-06-10
Previous: PRD7 (Speed Optimization - COMPLETED)

## Overview

This PRD captures the remaining enhancement items from PRD7's Phase 3 and deferred Phase 4 work.
Focus on user experience improvements, performance monitoring, and system scalability.

## Objectives

1. Optimize Gemini processing for 50-60% speed improvement
2. Enable batch processing for multiple cards
3. Implement intelligent caching for frequently scanned cards
4. Add comprehensive performance monitoring
5. Enhance error recovery and resilience
6. Implement API rate limiting and quota management

## Phase 0: Gemini Processing Optimization (Priority: IMMEDIATE)

### Requirements
- Reduce Gemini processing time by 50-60%
- Maintain or improve card identification accuracy
- Minimize API costs through efficient model usage
- Support all existing tier-based processing features

### Quick Wins (1-2 days)
1. **Switch to Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental**
   - Update model from `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
   - 2x faster processing with similar accuracy
   - Simple configuration change in environment variables

2. **More Aggressive Image Resizing**
   - Fast tier: 512px max dimension (from 800px)
   - Standard tier: 768px max dimension (from 1024px)
   - Enhanced tier: 1024px (unchanged for quality)
   - Expected 30-40% reduction in processing time

3. **Ultra-Minimal Prompt Optimization**
   - Fast tier: 25-word prompt, single-line JSON output
   - Remove formatting instructions and examples
   - Focus only on essential fields: name, set, number
   - Reduce token usage by 40-50%

### Advanced Optimizations (3-5 days)
1. **Streaming API Implementation**
   - Use Gemini streaming responses
   - Start TCG search as soon as Pokemon name is extracted
   - Progressive result display
   - Reduces perceived latency by 1-2 seconds

2. **Enhanced Client-Side Processing**
   - WebP compression at quality 75 (from 85)
   - Progressive JPEG encoding for fallback
   - Client-side HEIC to JPEG conversion
   - Reduce upload size by 25-35%

3. **Parallel Processing Architecture**
   - Concurrent quality assessment and Gemini calls
   - Pre-initialize Gemini model on startup
   - Connection pooling for all external APIs
   - Async improvements throughout pipeline

### Implementation Details
```python
# Quick wins config changes
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
IMAGE_MAX_DIMENSION_FAST=512
IMAGE_MAX_DIMENSION_STANDARD=768
WEBP_QUALITY=75

# Ultra-minimal prompt
FAST_PROMPT = "Card: name, set, number. JSON only: "
```

### Expected Performance Improvements
- **Fast tier**: 3-4s → 1-1.5s (60% reduction)
- **Standard tier**: 5-6s → 2-3s (50% reduction)
- **Enhanced tier**: 6-8s → 4-5s (35% reduction)
- **API cost reduction**: 30-40% through reduced tokens and smaller images

## Phase 1: Batch Processing Support

### Requirements
- Upload and process multiple card images in a single request
- Parallel processing with progress tracking
- Individual results for each card in the batch
- Batch size limits (e.g., max 10 cards per batch)

### Implementation
- New `/api/v1/scan/batch` endpoint
- Frontend multi-file selection and upload
- Progress indicators for each card
- Results gallery view

## Phase 2: Intelligent Caching

### Requirements
- Cache frequently scanned cards to reduce API calls
- LRU cache with configurable size
- Cache invalidation strategy
- Hit rate monitoring

### Implementation
- Redis or in-memory cache for card results
- Cache key based on image hash
- TTL configuration per tier
- Cache warming for popular cards

## Phase 3: Performance Monitoring

### Requirements
- Real-time performance metrics dashboard
- Historical performance trends
- API usage analytics
- Cost tracking and reporting

### Implementation
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Grafana dashboard
- Custom metrics endpoints
- Automated alerts for performance degradation

## Phase 4: Enhanced Error Recovery

### Requirements
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern for external APIs
- Graceful degradation strategies
- User-friendly error messages

### Implementation
- Tenacity retry decorators
- Circuit breaker for Gemini/TCG APIs
- Fallback responses
- Error classification and handling

## Phase 5: API Management

### Requirements
- Rate limiting per IP/user
- API key management
- Usage quotas and billing
- Developer portal

### Implementation
- FastAPI rate limiter middleware
- API key generation and validation
- Usage tracking database
- OpenAPI documentation

## Phase 6: Backend Optimization

### Requirements
- Connection pooling for external APIs
- Async processing optimization
- Database query optimization
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Implementation
- httpx connection pooling
- Async task queuing
- Database indexing
- Performance profiling

## Success Metrics

- Gemini processing: <1.5s for fast tier, <3s for standard tier
- Batch processing: <10s for 5 cards
- Cache hit rate: >60% for popular cards
- API availability: >99.9% uptime
- Error rate: <0.1% for valid requests
- API cost reduction: >30% through optimizations
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5 rating
