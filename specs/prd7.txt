# PRD 7: Speed Optimization and Intelligent Processing Pipeline

## Version
7.0 - Speed Optimization Focus

## Overview
This PRD outlines comprehensive speed optimization strategies for the Pokemon card scanner, including image quality assessment, intelligent processing pipelines, and performance improvements to achieve sub-2 second processing times.

## Problem Statement
Current processing times of 4-7 seconds per scan create a poor user experience, especially when scanning multiple cards. Users expect near-instant results similar to modern mobile apps. Additionally, processing all images with the same pipeline regardless of quality wastes computational resources and time.

## Goals
1. Achieve sub-2 second processing time for standard quality images
2. Implement intelligent quality-based processing pipeline
3. Reduce API costs through smart model selection
4. Provide real-time quality feedback to users
5. Maintain or improve card identification accuracy

## Core Features

### 1. Image Quality Assessment Module
- **Blur Detection**: Fast Laplacian variance calculation
- **Resolution Check**: Verify minimum required dimensions
- **Lighting Analysis**: Detect over/under exposure
- **Card Detection**: Verify card presence and orientation
- **Quality Score**: 0-100 composite score for routing decisions

### 2. Multi-Tier Processing Pipeline
- **Tier 1 - Fast Path (Quality > 80)**:
  - Resize to 512x512
  - Use Gemini Flash model
  - Skip enhancement steps
  - Target: <1 second
  
- **Tier 2 - Standard Path (Quality 50-80)**:
  - Resize to 768x768
  - Basic enhancement (contrast/sharpness)
  - Use Gemini Flash model
  - Target: 1-2 seconds
  
- **Tier 3 - Enhanced Path (Quality < 50)**:
  - Resize to 1024x1024
  - Full enhancement pipeline
  - Use Gemini Pro model
  - Target: 2-4 seconds

### 3. Optimization Strategies

#### Frontend Optimizations
- **Client-side resizing**: Reduce to 1024x1024 before upload
- **Progressive JPEG**: Enable faster perceived loading
- **WebP format**: 25-35% smaller file sizes
- **Lazy loading**: Only process visible cards in batch mode

#### Backend Optimizations
- **Async processing**: Non-blocking image operations
- **Connection pooling**: Reuse API connections
- **Batch API calls**: Combine multiple card lookups

#### Model Optimizations
- **Prompt optimization**: Shorter, focused prompts
- **Fallback strategies**: Quick retry with different models


### 4 . Quality Feedback System
- **Real-time indicators**:
  - Quality score badge (Excellent/Good/Poor)
  - Specific improvement tips
  - Visual quality meter
  
- **Actionable feedback**:
  - "Move to better lighting" 
  - "Hold camera steady"
  - "Move closer to card"
  - "Clean camera lens"
